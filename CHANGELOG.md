## [1.4.0](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/compare/v1.3.3...v1.4.0)

In this release, we made **no changes** to OpenCRVS Core. All changes in this release apply only to the [OpenCRVS country configuration](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/releases/tag/v1.4.0) repository.

### Please note for 1.5.0 release

In the next OpenCRVS release v1.5.0, there will be two significant changes both in the country resource package and the infrastructure configuration inside of it:

- The `infrastructure` directory and related pipelines will be moved to a new repository.
- Both the new infrastructure repository and the OpenCRVS country resource package repositories will start following their own release cycles, mostly independent from the core's release cycle. From this release forward, both packages are released as "OpenCRVS minor compatible" releases, meaning that the OpenCRVS countryconfig 1.3.0-<incrementing release number> is compatible with OpenCRVS 1.3.0, 1.3.1, 1.3.2, etc. This allows for the release of new hotfix versions of the core without having to publish a new version of the infrastructure or countryconfig.

## [1.3.3](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/compare/v1.3.2...v1.3.3)

## Breaking changes

## New features

- #### New handlebars serving the location ids of the admin level locations
  Apart from the new handlebars, a couple more improvements were introduced:
  - stricter type for locations in client
  - **"location"** handlebar helper can now resolve offices & facilities
  - restrict the properties exposed through **"location"** handlebar helper
  - remove deprecated **DIVISION** & **UNION** from client

## Bug fixes

- #### Fix location seeding scripts throwing error when there are too many source locations from the country config
  Locations are now seeded in smaller segments instead of one big collection. The newer approach has improved performance to a significant extent and also clears the interruption caused for a large number of country config locations
- Filter user information such as usernames and authentication codes from server logs
- Core not recognizing "occupation" as an optional field for deceased
- Unassign declaration from a user if the declaration has already been proceeded through the workqueues by a separate user

## Dependency upgrades

- #### Metabase from v0.45.2.1 to v0.46.6.1
